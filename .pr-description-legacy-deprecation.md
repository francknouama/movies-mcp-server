# Deprecate Legacy Server and Update Documentation

## Summary

This PR officially deprecates the legacy custom MCP server in favor of the SDK-based server, adding comprehensive deprecation notices and updating all documentation to recommend the SDK server for all deployments.

## 🎯 Changes Overview

### New Deprecation Documentation

**Created `cmd/server/DEPRECATED.md`** (160 lines)
- Clear deprecation notice at legacy server location
- Comprehensive comparison: SDK vs Legacy
- Migration guide for developers and deployments
- Timeline for potential removal (Q1 2025)
- Links to all SDK migration documentation

### README Updates

**Updated main README.md**:
- ✅ Added prominent deprecation warning at top
- ✅ Expanded "Server Status" section with clear guidance
- ✅ Updated project structure with status markers
- ✅ All sections now recommend SDK server
- ✅ Links to migration documentation

**Key Sections Updated:**
1. **Top Banner**: Added ⚠️ deprecation notice
2. **SDK Migration Section**: Renamed to "Server Status" with clear table
3. **Project Structure**: Marked legacy directories with ⚠️ DEPRECATED
4. **Quick Start**: Already uses SDK server (no changes needed)

### Settings Update

**`.claude/settings.local.json`**:
- Added permissions for git operations (fetch, pull, merge)
- Added cat permission for file viewing

## 📊 What Changed

### Before This PR

```markdown
### Two Server Options

| Server | Status | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| SDK Server | ✅ Recommended | Production use |
| Custom Server | ⚠️ Legacy | Backwards compatibility |
```

### After This PR

```markdown
### ⚠️ Server Status: Legacy Server Deprecated

| Server | Status | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| SDK Server | ✅ Active & Recommended | All deployments |
| Legacy Server | ⚠️ DEPRECATED | Testing only |

**IMPORTANT:** The legacy custom server has been deprecated.
All users should migrate to the SDK-based server.

**Migration:** See cmd/server/DEPRECATED.md for details.
```

## 🔍 Deprecation Rationale

### Why Deprecate Now?

1. **SDK Migration 100% Complete**
   - All 23 tools migrated and tested
   - All 3 resources migrated and tested
   - 58 comprehensive unit tests
   - BDD tests validate both servers

2. **Feature Parity Validated**
   - CI/CD runs BDD tests against both servers
   - Matrix strategy ensures behavioral compatibility
   - 100% feature parity proven automatically

3. **SDK Server Advantages**
   - Official Golang MCP SDK v1.1.0
   - 26% less code (eliminated ~1,200 lines)
   - Better type safety and maintainability
   - Automatic schema generation
   - Maintained by Anthropic and Google

4. **Production Ready**
   - Comprehensive testing (58 unit + BDD)
   - CI/CD validation on every push
   - Complete documentation
   - Migration guide available

### Why Keep Legacy Server?

**Not deleting legacy code because:**

1. **BDD Testing**: CI needs both servers for feature parity validation
2. **Backwards Compatibility**: Some users may need transition time
3. **Comparison**: Developers can compare implementations
4. **Validation**: Proves SDK server maintains compatibility

**Timeline:**
- **Now**: Deprecated (use SDK server for all new work)
- **Q1 2025**: May be archived after SDK server proven in production
- **Future**: Will be removed when no longer needed for testing

## 📁 Files Changed

### Created
- `cmd/server/DEPRECATED.md` - Comprehensive deprecation notice

### Modified
- `README.md` - Added deprecation warnings and updated guidance
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Added git permissions

### Not Modified (Already SDK-First)
- Quick Start section already uses SDK server
- Claude Desktop integration already uses SDK server
- Build instructions already recommend SDK server

## ✅ Deprecation Coverage

### Documentation Updated
- ✅ Main README has prominent warnings
- ✅ Legacy server directory has DEPRECATED.md
- ✅ Project structure marked with status
- ✅ Migration guide provided
- ✅ Links to SDK documentation

### User Guidance
- ✅ Clear "use SDK server" messaging
- ✅ Migration steps documented
- ✅ Comparison table (SDK vs Legacy)
- ✅ Timeline for removal provided
- ✅ Support status clarified

### Development Guidance
- ✅ New features: SDK server only
- ✅ Bug fixes: SDK server first
- ✅ Refactoring: Focus on SDK
- ✅ Testing: Both servers via BDD

## 🎯 Impact

### For Users
- **New Users**: Clear guidance to use SDK server
- **Existing Users**: Migration path documented
- **Claude Desktop**: Already configured for SDK server

### For Developers
- **Feature Development**: SDK server only
- **Bug Fixes**: SDK server priority
- **Testing**: Both servers via CI/CD
- **Documentation**: SDK server focus

### For Codebase
- **Clarity**: Status of each component clear
- **Maintainability**: Focus on SDK server
- **Testing**: Continuous validation of both
- **Future**: Path to eventual legacy removal

## 📊 SDK Migration Progress

| Component | Status | Tests | Documentation |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------------|
| **23 Tools** | ✅ Complete | 46 unit tests | ✅ Complete |
| **3 Resources** | ✅ Complete | 12 unit tests | ✅ Complete |
| **BDD Tests** | ✅ Both servers | CI/CD validated | ✅ Complete |
| **Documentation** | ✅ SDK-first | N/A | ✅ Complete |
| **Deprecation** | ✅ Announced | N/A | ✅ This PR |

## 🚀 Next Steps

With deprecation notices in place:

1. **Immediate**: All new work uses SDK server
2. **Short-term**: Monitor SDK server in production
3. **Mid-term**: Gather feedback on migration
4. **Long-term**: Archive legacy server (Q1 2025)

### Future Cleanup (Separate PRs)

**Could be done later:**
- Move legacy code to `legacy/` directory
- Create archive branch for legacy server
- Remove deprecated code when safe
- Simplify project structure

**Not in this PR because:**
- Legacy server still needed for BDD testing
- Some users may need transition time
- Want to prove SDK server in production first

## 💡 Key Messages

### For New Users
> Use the SDK server at `cmd/server-sdk/`. It's the official, supported, recommended implementation.

### For Existing Users
> Migrate to the SDK server. See `cmd/server/DEPRECATED.md` for step-by-step guide. Test with BDD tests.

### For Developers
> All new development on SDK server. Legacy server is maintenance-only for critical bugs.

### For Contributors
> Focus on `internal/mcp/` (SDK handlers). Ignore `internal/interfaces/`, `internal/schemas/`, `internal/server/` (legacy).
