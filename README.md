# Movies MCP Server

A production-ready **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for intelligent movie database management, built with Clean Architecture principles and optimized for AI-assisted environments.

> **ðŸŽ‰ Powered by Official Golang MCP SDK v1.1.0**
> Built with the official MCP SDK maintained by Anthropic and Google, providing type safety, automatic schema generation, and production-ready reliability. See [SDK Migration](#sdk-migration) for migration details.

> **âœ… SDK-Only Implementation**
> The legacy custom server has been **archived**. This project now uses only the official SDK-based server at `cmd/server-sdk/`. See [Server Status](#-server-status-sdk-only-implementation) for details.

## What is Movies MCP Server?

Movies MCP Server is a sophisticated movie database management system that communicates via the **Model Context Protocol**â€”designed specifically for integration with AI assistants like Claude. Unlike traditional HTTP APIs, it uses JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout to provide seamless, intelligent movie and actor data operations.

**Perfect for:**
- AI-powered movie recommendation systems
- Claude Desktop integrations
- Intelligent film analysis and exploration
- Director career research
- Movie database management with AI assistance
