# CI/CD Enhancement: Add BDD Tests for Both Servers

## Summary

This PR enhances the GitHub Actions CI pipeline to automatically test both legacy and SDK servers using BDD tests in a parallel matrix strategy, ensuring continuous validation of feature parity and behavioral compatibility.

## 🎯 Changes Overview

### New Job: `bdd-tests`

Added a new CI job that runs BDD tests against both server implementations in parallel:

```yaml
bdd-tests:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      server: [legacy, sdk]
    fail-fast: false
  env:
    TEST_MCP_SERVER: ${{ matrix.server }}
```

### Enhanced Job: `test`

Updated the existing test job to explicitly test SDK components:

- Build both server binaries (legacy + SDK)
- Run SDK unit tests explicitly (58 tests)
- Upload both binaries as artifacts

## 📊 What Gets Tested

### Matrix Strategy

| Server | Database | Tests | Artifacts |
|--------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Legacy** | Postgres 16 | All BDD scenarios | Results uploaded |
| **SDK** | Postgres 16 | All BDD scenarios | Results uploaded |

Both runs execute in parallel with `fail-fast: false`, ensuring complete test coverage even if one fails.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Database Setup

Each BDD test run gets its own PostgreSQL 16 instance:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    env:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: movies_mcp_test
    options: >-
      --health-cmd pg_isready
      --health-interval 10s
      --health-timeout 5s
      --health-retries 5
```

### Migration Handling

Smart migration logic based on server type:

```bash
if [ "${{ matrix.server }}" = "sdk" ]; then
  go build -o migrate-tool ./cmd/server-sdk/main.go
  ./migrate-tool -migrate-only
else
  go build -o migrate-tool ./cmd/server/main.go
  ./migrate-tool -migrate-only
fi
```

### Test Execution

```bash
echo "Testing ${{ matrix.server }} server implementation"
go test -v -timeout 5m ./tests/bdd/...
```

The `TEST_MCP_SERVER` environment variable automatically selects the correct server binary.

## 💡 Benefits

### 1. Automated Feature Parity Validation
- Every commit validates both implementations
- Catches behavioral differences immediately
- Ensures SDK server is true drop-in replacement

### 2. Parallel Execution
- Legacy and SDK tests run simultaneously
- No additional CI time overhead
- Independent failure isolation

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
- **Unit Tests:** All application logic
- **SDK Tests:** 58 tests for tools + resources
- **Integration Tests:** Database interactions
- **BDD Tests:** End-to-end scenarios × 2 servers

### 4. Early Regression Detection
- API compatibility issues caught early
- Behavioral differences identified
- Database migration problems detected
- Performance comparisons available

### 5. Continuous Confidence
- Validates SDK migration continuously
- Proves feature parity automatically
- Documents expected behavior
- Enables safe refactoring

## 📈 Impact

### Before This PR
```
CI Pipeline
├── test: Unit + Integration tests
├── lint: Code quality
├── security: Vulnerability scanning
└── validate-dependencies: Outdated deps

❌ BDD tests excluded (grep -v tests/bdd)
❌ SDK server not tested in CI
❌ Feature parity validation was manual
❌ No automated behavioral compatibility checks
```

### After This PR
```
CI Pipeline
├── test: Unit + Integration + SDK tests (58)
├── bdd-tests (legacy): Full BDD scenarios
├── bdd-tests (sdk): Full BDD scenarios
├── lint: Code quality
├── security: Vulnerability scanning
└── validate-dependencies: Outdated deps

✅ BDD tests run automatically
✅ Both servers tested in parallel
✅ Feature parity validated on every push
✅ SDK unit tests explicitly executed
✅ Comprehensive automated testing
```
