// Integration tests for the Movies MCP Server
//
// NOTE: The integration tests are currently being updated to work with the new
// server architecture that was implemented during the server package reorganization.
//
// The server package has been reorganized to follow Clean Architecture principles with:
// - Dependency injection through the composition package
// - Pure MCP protocol handling in the server package
// - Separation of concerns between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
//
// The existing integration tests (backed up as .bak files) need to be rewritten to:
// 1. Use the new MCPServer structure with input/output streams
// 2. Leverage the composition.Container for dependency injection
// 3. Work with the updated MCP protocol implementation
//
// Until these tests are updated, comprehensive unit tests provide coverage for:
// - All domain logic and business rules
// - Application services and use cases
// - MCP protocol handling and validation
// - Infrastructure components (repositories, etc.)
