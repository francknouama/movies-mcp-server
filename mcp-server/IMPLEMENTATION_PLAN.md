# Movies MCP Server - Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for new features to enhance the Movies MCP Server functionality. Features are organized by priority and logical dependencies.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Cast/Actors Management (High Priority)
**Objective:** Enable comprehensive actor management and movie-actor relationships

#### Tasks:
1. **Database Schema**
   - Create `actors` table with fields: id, name, birth_date, biography, photo_url
   - Create `movie_actors` junction table with fields: movie_id, actor_id, role, billing_order
   - Add migration files for both tables

2. **Models and Database Layer**
   - Create Actor model in `internal/models/`
   - Add database queries for actor CRUD operations
   - Add queries for movie-actor relationships

3. **MCP Tools Implementation**
   - `add_actor` - Add new actor to database
   - `link_actor_to_movie` - Associate actor with movie and role
   - `get_movie_cast` - Retrieve all actors for a specific movie
   - `get_actor_movies` - Get all movies for a specific actor

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for actor models
   - Integration tests for actor database operations
   - Tests for all new MCP tools

### Phase 2: Enhanced Search Capabilities (High Priority)
**Objective:** Provide advanced search options for better movie discovery

#### Tasks:
1. **search_by_decade Tool**
   - Accept decade input (e.g., "1980s", "2000s")
   - Return movies from specified decade
   - Support pagination

2. **search_by_rating_range Tool**
   - Accept min and max rating parameters
   - Filter movies within rating range
   - Include count statistics

3. **search_similar_movies Tool**
   - Accept movie_id as input
   - Find movies with matching genres and/or director
   - Implement similarity scoring algorithm

4. **Testing**
   - Tests for decade parsing and filtering
   - Tests for rating range validation
   - Tests for similarity algorithm

### Phase 3: User Reviews System (Medium Priority)
**Objective:** Add community features through user reviews and ratings

#### Tasks:
1. **Database Schema**
   - Create `reviews` table: id, movie_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at, updated_at
   - Add indexes for movie_id and user_id
   - Create migration

2. **Models and Database Layer**
   - Create Review model
   - Add review CRUD operations
   - Implement review aggregation queries

3. **MCP Tools Implementation**
   - `add_review` - Create new review for movie
   - `get_movie_reviews` - Get all reviews for a movie
   - `update_review` - Update existing review
   - `delete_review` - Remove review

4. **Integration**
   - Add review statistics to movie responses
   - Include average user rating alongside IMDB rating

5. **Testing**
   - Review validation tests
   - Aggregation calculation tests
   - Integration tests for review tools

### Phase 4: Movie Collections (Medium Priority)
**Objective:** Support grouping of related movies into collections

#### Tasks:
1. **Database Schema**
   - Create `collections` table: id, name, description, created_at
   - Create `collection_movies` junction table: collection_id, movie_id, order_index
   - Add migrations

2. **Models and Database Layer**
   - Create Collection model
   - Add collection CRUD operations
   - Implement collection-movie relationship queries

3. **MCP Tools Implementation**
   - `create_collection` - Create new collection
   - `add_to_collection` - Add movie to collection
   - `get_collection` - Get all movies in collection
   - `list_collections` - List all available collections

4. **Resource Endpoints**
   - Add `movies://collections/all` resource
   - Add `movies://collections/{id}` resource

5. **Testing**
   - Collection management tests
   - Order preservation tests
   - Resource endpoint tests

### Phase 5: Batch Operations (Low Priority)
**Objective:** Enable bulk data management operations

#### Tasks:
1. **import_movies_csv Tool**
   - CSV parsing with validation
   - Support for common CSV formats
   - Progress reporting for large imports
   - Error handling with rollback

2. **batch_update_movies Tool**
   - Accept array of movie updates
   - Transactional updates
   - Validation for each movie
   - Summary report of changes

3. **export_movies Tool**
   - Support multiple formats (CSV, JSON)
   - Filtering options
   - Include/exclude fields configuration

4. **Testing**
   - CSV parsing tests
   - Transaction rollback tests
   - Export format tests

### Phase 6: Documentation and Tooling (Low Priority)
**Objective:** Update documentation and development tools

#### Tasks:
1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README.md with new tools
   - Add usage examples for each feature
   - Update API documentation

2. **Bruno Collection Updates**
   - Add requests for all new MCP tools
   - Include example payloads
   - Add collection organization

## Technical Considerations

### Database Performance
- Add appropriate indexes for new search queries
- Consider partitioning for reviews table if volume grows
- Implement query optimization for complex joins

### Backwards Compatibility
- All new features should be additive
- Existing tools must continue to work unchanged
- Database migrations must be reversible

### Error Handling
- Consistent error format across new tools
- Meaningful error messages for validation failures
- Proper transaction handling for data integrity

### Testing Strategy
- Maintain >80% test coverage
- Integration tests for all new tools
- Performance tests for search operations
- Load tests for batch operations

## Success Metrics
- All new tools properly integrated with MCP protocol
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation updated
- Performance benchmarks met
- Backwards compatibility maintained

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 days
- Phase 2: 2 days
- Phase 3: 2-3 days
- Phase 4: 2 days
- Phase 5: 2-3 days
- Phase 6: 1 day

Total estimated time: 12-16 days of development

## Notes
- Priority should be given to high-value features that enhance core functionality
- Each phase should be completed with full tests before moving to the next
- Regular commits and PR reviews for each feature
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
